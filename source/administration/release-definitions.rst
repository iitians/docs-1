Release Definitions
========================

Mattermost adopts a monthly tick-tock release cycle, with a new version shipping on the 16th of each month in `binary form <http://docs.mattermost.com/administration/upgrade.html>`_.

Tick-tock refers to even-numbered releases (e.g., v5.6) containing new features, and odd-numbered releases (e.g., v5.7) containing only bug fixes and performance improvements.

Feature Release
----------------

The Feature Release has new features added. These are even-numbered releases (e.g., v5.6).

Quality Release
----------------

The Quality Release contains only bug fixes and performance improvement and is more stable. These are odd-numbered releases (e.g., v5.7). It is highly recommended to upgrade to Quality Releases for quality and stability.

Extended Support Release (ESR)
------------------------------

Extended Support Releases are releases that are maintained for a longer period of time and that will receive backports for security fixes and major bug fixes for the length of their life cycle.
